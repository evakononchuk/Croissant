        A croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that contains
        dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture.
        <br />Croissants belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked
        goods along with brioche, Danish and puff pastries. <br />A

        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
        shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
        laminated dough.

        are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with
        butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into
        a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
        layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
